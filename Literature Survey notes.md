## Notes

### Thoughts:

- Not truly decentralized until decentralized cloud computation/storage available:
  - IPFS (content-aware database)
  - Akash (decentralized computing)
  - What else?
- Governance often token-based
  - Enables/encourages oligarchy
- Play-to-earn a potential model for non-gaming DAOs:
  - Effort in => Rewards out
  - Those who contribute more earn more
    - Reputation-based voting where everyone gets one vote, but all votes are public?
      - Public voting could be a pitfall
  - 



### Technology:

- **Interesting protocols**
  - iBTC: non-custodial wrapped inverse BTC, a way to short BTC without a futures contract
  - RenBTC: non-custodial wrapped BTC (BTC on the ETH blockchain)
  -
